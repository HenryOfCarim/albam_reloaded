# Albam Reloaded
My amateurish try to port the Sebastian Branchi's albam addon to blender 2.80+

I fixed all errors during import-export but it didn't tested enough to say it works confidently, based on 0.3-alpha
# Installing
However you can try it even now, just download the code as a zip, unpack it somewhere then open Blender,
go to Edit>Preference>Add-ons>Install , open albam_reloaded folder and press Install Add-on
Turn it on after installing
